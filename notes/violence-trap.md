##### 研究假设

暴力陷阱：
Raising the economic costs that violent domestic conflict imposes on domestic elites can remove the necessity of paying rents to deter violence and thus allow a transformation of the state towards ‘open access order’. Yet, the main way to raise the
economic cost of domestic fighting is to promote specialisation and integration of
economic activity across major political cleavages. Domestic actors will be able to
make such investments only if certain political reforms – such as those allowing
anyone to form a business firm – are already in place. They will be willing to invest
in projects that rely on cooperation between potentially combatant groups only if
they think the risk of actual conflict is sufficiently low. Thus, complex specialised
economies cannot be established without reformed and politically stable states and
reformed and stable states cannot be created without complex specialised economies.
