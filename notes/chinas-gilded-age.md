This book rebels against China’s exceptionalism narrative in contrasting contemporary China with the nineteenth-century United States. The Gilded Age of the US in the nineteenth century, the age of the robber barons where corruption fuelled economic growth and inequality, is set against former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping’s post-1978 economic liberalisation in which corruption played a similar role.

Corruption has been long identified as a widespread problem in both the developed and developing worlds. It is often associated with poverty traps (Ray Fisman and Miriam A. Golden, 2017). Corruption tends to be related to institutional weakness, with misallocation of resources that inhibit economic growth, and positioned as a scourge to investment. The book shows that this picture is not true.

The author introduces four typologies of corruption and measures the countries employing them. The four typologies are a handy way to conceptualise corruption: namely, as petty theft; grand theft; speed money; and access money. Each type of corruption has different effects on economic performance. Petty theft and grand theft, which are more common in patrimonial states, are like toxic drugs that poison the economic body and especially hurt the poor. Speed money – for example, bribes to low- and mid-level bureaucrats in exchange for a permit – is like a painkiller: it eases a problem but damages the body. Finally, access money is a very different kind of drug. It is like a steroid or a performance enhancement drug in sport. It facilitates growth, for example, by allowing large corporations to win public contracts, deregulate a market, etc. Access money is access to the decision-makers, and these, in turn, grant access to more business opportunities. This type of corruption enhances economic growth by increasing investment but taxes the social body with rising inequality.

The Unbundled Corruption Score calculated with the survey results solves the paradox. The US and China, together with Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Indonesia, share a trait: their dominant type of corruption is access money. The US case has institutionalised access money, lobbying and revolving doors (the conflict of interest arising from people going out from government and regulatory institutions to businesses and out from businesses back to government). For China, it is more dependent on personal relationships with the top bureaucracy. However, the effects are the same – access to business opportunities – and the side effect in both cases is rising inequality. China managed to grow so fast because it could rein in the other three types of corruption. It enacted a series of reforms, for example, eliminating cash payments, consolidating accounts, strengthening budget and accounting standards and managing the fourth type through profit-sharing.

Corruption in China’s case is handled through a profit-sharing arrangement. This arrangement has turned the Chinese bureaucracy into what Mancur Olson (2000) called ‘stationary bandits’ rather than the more harmful ‘roving bandits’. Because of this handling of corruption, bureaucracy is invested in development. China has a stake in attracting investment; by not scaring off business opportunities, it profits from economic growth.

China’s fast economic growth over the last 40 years is remarkable: it is among the most, if not the most successful story of development in history. Still, inequality is rising. It is now comparable to that of the US, Mexico and other high inequality countries, and that is a source of concern for China’s government. Rising inequality is a source of potential conflict: it threatens stability. That is why, over the last decades, China has been implementing its own ‘Progressive Era’ type of policies. First, with the ones taken under Premier Zhu Rongji at the end of the 1990s and continuing to this day with President Xi Jinping’s large-scale anti-corruption campaigns.

China’s Gilded Age presents the most sophisticated analysis of corruption to date. It is nuanced, full of context, with methodological innovations. It challenges us to transcend the usual cliches about corruption and examines the topic thoughtfully. The book draws from history to highlight how nothing is genuinely exceptional about Chinese corruption and its relation to growth. [^1]
