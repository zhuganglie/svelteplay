In summary, success in an evolutionary "game" correlated with the following characteristics:

- Be nice: cooperate, never be the first to defect.
- Be provocable: return defection for defection, cooperation for cooperation.
- Don't be envious: focus on maximizing your own 'score', as opposed to ensuring your score is higher than your 'partner's'.
- Don't be too clever: or, don't try to be tricky. Clarity is essential for others to cooperate with you.
