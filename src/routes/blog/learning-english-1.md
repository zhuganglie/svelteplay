<dt>What qualities do you usually look for in a product? </dt>
<dd>
<p>Nowadays, consumers are becoming more and more aware of the importance of product quality though they may have different views about what constitute good quality of a product. The following are what I usully look for when deciding to pay for a product.</p>

<p>First, a good product must be able to fulfill a personal need. When I buy a mobile phone, I expect it to enable me to contact my friend whenever I need to.</p>

<p>Second, a good product must be reliable. It is quite irritating that a product you bought ocaasionally failed to do what it is supposed to do.</p>

<p>Third, a product of good quality must be durable and solid. A well-known difference between branded product and conterfeit product is that branded product, which is made of solid material, is much more lasting than fake product that is of inferior quality.</p>

<p>There are some other qualities one can look for in a product, such as serviceability and aesthetics, but the above-mentioned three are the most important qualities I like to see when making a purchase.</p>

<dt>Do you think commercials can really affect behavior of buyers? Why or why not?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Businesses have invested considerable resources into advertisement, creating hype and halo around their brands. Although smart consumers figure out various ways to unscramble the magic, commercials remain effective in fluencing consumer behavior.</p>

<p>First of all, consumers are human beings. They are as emotional as they are rational. Marketters can use irrational advertising techniques to exert influence on the emotional side of human characters. For example, a shoe brand can stir up urgence to buy among consumers by advertising a new model that is for market testing purpose as limited edition.</p>

<p>Moreover, various data analysis techniques have made it much easier for markettiers to accurately identify consumer preference than before. With deep understanding of consumer preference, markettiers are able to engineer or optimize commercials in ways that communicate product features more appealingly to targeted audients.</p>

<p>In short, there are many ways by which commercials can really affect consumer behavior. </p>
</dd>

<dt>Do you think the quality of a product depends on how it is advertised? Why or why not?</dt>
<dd>  
<p>In my opinion, a heavily advertised product is likely to be of better quality.</p>

<p>It has been found that many brands have turned to new promotional tactics, focusing commercials more on quality image of brand than on features of its product. A local shoe brand, for example, named its brand as "Everbest", conveying that their quality is <em>always</em> the best in the market. If a business is willing to invest so much in creating a branded image, it is reasonable to believe that the business is serious about product quality and willing to invest efforts in improving product quality.</p>

<p>Additionally, product quality is a multi-demensional concept. Whether ot not a product is of good quality depends on how you define quality. For this reason, a well engineered advertising may educate its targeted group and construct a new way to perceive good product. Take durability of fashion prodcut for example. A fashion brand, which targets at low-income group, advertised its brand as "leading the fast-paced fashion". With such notion in mind, durability will be construed as "uneasy to follow the fast pace of fashion". Instead, consumers will perceive "cheap", which means easy to make change, as the most important quality.</p>

<dt>Tell
me about your experience of being in a place where there was happiness and a
good work-life balance. How
did you feel about it? Why do you
think people feel so overworked or stressed? </dt>
<dd>
<p>I work for a local retail company as a sales manager. My daily routine is to visit the retail outlets and help resolve problems in order for them to hit their monthly targets. This is great because I do not have to clock in and out every day. As there is no clear office hours, I can easily take some time to prepare dinner for my family and schedule appointment when necessary.</p>

<p>Another reason I like the job is that the job is full of challenge. I need to analyse problems, advise team members, and propose business solutions to improve sales revenue. This provides a good opportunity to develop problem-solving, teamwork, and leadership skills. I feel a strong sense of achievement when I see a report that shows great sales performance.</p>

<p>A sales manager tends to be overworked or stressed because they are multi-tasked and often burn candle at both ends. My way to avoid being worn out is to maintain a positive attitude to challenges and to manage time effectively by prioritzing tasks.</p>
