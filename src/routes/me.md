title: About Me
---

Hi, welcome to my website.

My name is Caesar. I am a professional trainer, currently serving for a learning center as instructional designer.

I am a optimistic guy. I believe no obstacle can not be overcome. I also believe tomorrow will be a bright day. Therefore, when others are playgued by various problems, I am able to stay calm with a belief that there are more solutions than problems. It is for this reason that I am often blamed for being hearless and simple-minded. The diagram below shows the logic behind my behavior.

I love reading as I am curious about who we are and why we are here. My reading scope is limited to popular science, philosophy, and social sciences.
